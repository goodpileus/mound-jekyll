DOCUMENTATION FOR OPERATIONS
----------------------------

create new post:
- create a new .md file in the _projects folder
- or copy one of the post templates from the _templates folder

----

create new category:
- just type a new category name into the 'category' field of a post. a new category will be generated
- make sure to then update the pattern for the new category by editing the 'patterns.css' file inside assets/css folder. it should look something like this:

  #category-name, .category-name {
    background-image: url('../img/hatches/sand1.gif');
  }

- categories will be ordered based on their name, so creating a naming/numbering convention is recommended

----

notes for posts:
- the 2 layouts for use are 'gallery' and 'text'
- 'gallery' generates the detailed project element with the dropdown
- 'text' generates a simple text element without the gallery features

- the 'custom' field is true/false. if true, it will generate the yellow banner that appears above the list of items to buy
- the custom disclaimer text that appears here can be edited in the 'custom-disclaimer.html' file inside the _includes folder. it's a good idea to keep this as short as possible to keep the design looking nice...

- the disclaimer that appears at the bottom of the page can be edited in the 'disclaimer.md' file in the _projects folder

- the 'product-title' field also generates the product's id that is being sent to paypal, so each product-title must be unique, otherwise errors may occur.
- the 'sold' field is true/false. if true, it will disable the paypal button and list the item as sold out. you can also just remove the item if you want it to be hidden.
